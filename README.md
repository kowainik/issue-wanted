`issue-wanted` is a web application focused on improving the open-source Haskell community by centralizing GitHub issues across many Haskell repositories into a single location. The goals of `issue-wanted` are to make it easier for programmers of all skill levels to find Haskell projects to contribute to, to increase the number of contributions to open-source Haskell projects, and to encourage more programmers to become a part of the Haskell community.
